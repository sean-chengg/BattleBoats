# BattleBoats
Created a simulated game of battleship that employed a User Interface that allowed for user input to play, used classes, nodes, and pointers that allowed for efficient game runtime using Java. Similar to Battleship, a game where the user attempts to sink the other player's battleboats. Includes 3 different game modes with differing ships and modes, where you can see the location of all boats.
